# Getting Started with Create React App

Hello and welcome to my DigitalWonderlab tech demo. This isn't a masterpiece, but hopefully it shows some level
of competence with React.

You should be able to run this project like any normal create-react-app project, but make sure your `npm ci`
dependencies are installed.

For this demo, I've created a small wrapper around NASA's image & video library, so that you can scrape their APIs for
anything of your choice. Fill out the search box, and click search to have a look. It should then render a bunch of
cards
displaying what was found - you can then copy the link to the image for sharing or favourite (though this doesn't save).

I've left a bunch of `@TODOs` over the code just to show where some of my thoughts were, but I didn't have time to
implement
some of them in a way that would be meaningful or demonstrative. If you have any questions, feel free to send me an
email.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
